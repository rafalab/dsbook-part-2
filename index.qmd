# Preface {.unnumbered}

This is the website for the **Statistics and Prediction Algorithms Through Case Studies**, the second part of **Introduction to Data Science**. 

The website for the first part, **Data Wrangling and Visualization with R**, is [here](http://rafalab.dfci.harvard.edu/dsbook-part-1/).

This book started out as part of the class notes used in the
 HarvardX [Data Science Series](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/harvardx-data-science).

A hardcopy version of the first edition of the book, which combined both parts, is available from [CRC Press](https://www.routledge.com/Introduction-to-Data-Science-Data-Analysis-and-Prediction-Algorithms-with/Irizarry/p/book/9780367357986?utm_source=author&utm_medium=shared_link&utm_campaign=B043135_jm1_5ll_6rm_t081_1al_introductiontodatascienceauthorshare).

A free PDF of the October 24, 2019 version of the book, which combined both parts, is available from [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/datasciencebook)^[https://leanpub.com/datasciencebook].

The Quarto code used to generate the book is available on  [GitHub](https://github.com/rafalab/dsbook-part-2).

# Acknowledgments {.unnumbered}

A special thanks to Amy Gill, Jorge Cornick, and  Barry MacLean for dozens of comments, edits, and suggestions. Also, many thanks to Stephanie Hicks who twice served as a co-instructor in my data science classes and Yihui Xie who patiently put up with my many questions about bookdown. Thanks also to Héctor Corrada-Bravo, for advice on how to best teach machine learning. Thanks to Alyssa Frazee for helping create the homework problem that became the Recommendation Systems case study. Also, many thanks to Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund for making the Quarto code for their R for Data Science book open. Finally, thanks to Alex Nones for proofreading the manuscript during its various stages.

This book was conceived during the teaching of several applied statistics courses, starting over fifteen years ago. The teaching assistants working with me throughout the years made important indirect contributions to this book. The latest iteration of this course is a HarvardX series coordinated by Heather Sternshein and Zofia Gajdos. We thank them for their contributions. We are also grateful to all the students whose questions and comments helped us improve the book. The courses were partially funded by NIH grant R25GM114818. We are very grateful to the National Institutes of Health for its support.
