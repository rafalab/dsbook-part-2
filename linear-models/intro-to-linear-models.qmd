# Linear Models {.unnumbered}

Up to this point, this book has focused mainly on datasets consisting of a single variable. However, in data analyses challenges, it is very common to be interested in the relationship between two or more variables. In this part of the book we introduce _linear models_, a general framework that unifies approaches used for analyzing association between variables, such as simple and multivariate regression, treatment effect models, and association tests. We will illustrate these using case studies related to understudying if height is hereditary, described in detail in [@sec-regression], using data to build a baseball team on a budget, described in detail in [@sec-multivariable-regression], determining if a high-fat diet makes mice heavier, described in detail in [@sec-treatment-effect-models], and examining if their is gender bias in research funding in the Netherlands, described in detail in [@sec-association-tests].
